Prompt Templates Repository

A curated, extensible collection of high-quality prompt templates designed for working with Large Language Models (LLMs).
This repository focuses on clarity, reusability, and practical applicability across domains such as software engineering, data science, research, education, content creation, and agent-based systems.

 Purpose

Prompt engineering plays a critical role in extracting reliable, structured, and high-quality outputs from LLMs.
This repository serves as a centralized library of reusable prompt templates

Template Design Philosophy

Each prompt template follows a structured and consistent format:

Role Definition – Clearly defines the persona or expertise of the model

Task Objective – Explicit description of what the model must accomplish

Context Injection – Where and how external data should be supplied

Constraints & Rules – Output limits, tone, formatting, or safety rules

Output Schema – Expected structure (bullet points, JSON, steps, etc.)

This design ensures:

Reduced hallucinations


Use Cases

LLM-powered applications and chatbots

Agentic workflows (planner, executor, evaluator loops)

RAG pipelines with structured prompting

Code assistants and developer tooling

Research and academic assistance

Content generation at scale

How to Use

Browse the relevant folder based on your use case

Copy the prompt template

Inject your task-specific context

Adjust constraints as needed

Use with any LLM (OpenAI, open-source models, local inference, etc.)

Improved consistency across runs

Better compatibility with automation and agents
