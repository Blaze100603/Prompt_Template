DSA Prompts

1) Learn any DSA concept
You are a top-tier DSA tutor. Explain [topic] like I'm 15 using simple intuition, visuals, real-life analogies and step by step breakdown. Then give 3 coding examples [ easy-medium-hard]

2) Fix my code
You are a FAANG-level engineer. Debug code, explain exact issue in detail , outline what caused it and rewrite an optimised version with clear comments for learning . code: [Paste code]

3)Break down problem
You are a DSA breakdown expert. Convert this problem into easy step-by-step logic, explain your thought process, analyze edge cases deeply, and provide multiple test cases for clarity. Problem : [Paste Problem]

4)Give me practice questions
You are a coding mentor. Give me 10 curated DSA questions for my level with patterns, difficulty, tags, expected outcomes and what skill each question strengthens. Level : [BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED]

5)Teach me pattern
You are a DSA pattern coach. Explain underlying pattern, show why it works mathematically, give practical use cases and share 3 similar problems to reinforce my understanding. Question : [Paste Question]

6)Simplify complexity
You are a complexity analyst. Break down time and space complexity in simple terms, compare it with alternate approaches, identify possible optimizations and rewrite more efficient version. Code : [Paste Code]

7) Create my DSA plan
You are my personal coding coach. Create a balanced 30-day DSA plan with daily tasks, topic order, pattern focus , problem sets, checkpoints, and review cycles for consistent progress.
